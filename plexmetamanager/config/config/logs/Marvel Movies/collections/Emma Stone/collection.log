                                                                 |

As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother and made her television debut in In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that produced only an unsold pilot. After small television roles, she made her film debut in Superbad (2007), and received positive media attention for her role in Zombieland (2009). The 2010 teen comedy Easy A was Stone's first starring role, earning her nominations for the BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.
                                                                 |

She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing a recovering drug addict in the black comedy Birdman (2014), and her Broadway debut came in a revival of the musical Cabaret (2014–2015). She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for playing an aspiring actress in the romantic musical La La Land (2016). Stone received a third Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Abigail Masham in the historical comedy-drama The Favourite (2018).
