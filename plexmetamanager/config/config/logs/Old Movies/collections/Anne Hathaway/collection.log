Her films have grossed over $6.8 billion worldwide, and she appeared on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list in 2009.
                                                                 |

As a teenager, she was cast in the television series Get Real (1999–2000) and made her breakthrough as the protagonist in her debut film, the Disney comedy The Princess Diaries (2001). Hathaway made a transition to adult roles with the 2005 dramas Havoc and Brokeback Mountain.

She went on to star in the commercially successful romances Bride Wars (2009), Valentine's Day (2010) and Love & Other Drugs (2010), and the fantasy film Alice in Wonderland (2010).
