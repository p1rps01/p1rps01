'TV Shows.yml' V1.0  
The Primetime trakt list is maintanied by me. It is American shows that are on the broadcast network channels during primetime hours.  
New shows are added at the beginning of the TV Season (Fall, Spring). This list is public and can be used by you.

The current networks in the config are:
HBO, CInemax, Showtime, Netflix, Hulu, Syfy, Starz, HGTV, TBS, National Geographic, Prime Video, YouTube, Disney+, Apple+, Discovery, A&E
